# My Brain Storm (mbs)

This repository is my personal knowledge base, learning log, and the backend of all my projects.

Here I keep:
- What I study
- What I build
- How I think about software
- The reasoning behind my projects and products

This repo connects my university work, side projects, labs, and Astraly into one system.
